## Roadmap/Features
- torrent views and updating with mock objects
- integration of ttorrent - may have to modify the way it saves files
- settings for wifi - wifi only
- shutdown of the app and all connections
- sorting/filtering of torrents
- settings for number of concurrent connections
- pause all/resume all on notification drawer
- settings for download location
- settings for specific wifi only

Maybe the torrent stuff is wrapped in a facade to keep from placing the library code everywhere?
