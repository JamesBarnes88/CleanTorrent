# CleanTorrent
An android torrent client solution with unobtrusive ads, a clean interface, and convenient features for the daily
android torrent user. It is based off of ttorent as the client library.

## Reasons
For every torrent application I have used there is always a compromise. Either it is so full of advertisements that the
application becomes unusable or it looks terrible. This project is meant to be a joining of the two with minimal
advertisements, if any. No full screen ads/video ads. No glitchy shutdown modals. Easy access to essential features
in the notification drawer. Easy to toggle wifi only switch.
